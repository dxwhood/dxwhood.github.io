This is a test post.

Here's a code snippet:

```python
def hello_world():
    print("Hello, world!")

hello_world()
```

And here's a MathJax equation:

$$
L(y, \hat{y}) = -\frac{1}{N}\sum_{i=1}^{N} y_i \log(\hat{y_i}) + (1 - y_i) \log(1 - \hat{y_i})
$$

This is the binary cross-entropy loss function, commonly used in binary classification tasks.
